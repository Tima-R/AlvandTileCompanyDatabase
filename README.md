# AlvandTileCompanyDatabase
A MySQL database project for managing operations of the Alvand Tile manufacturing company, including production, personnel, and environmental data.

## Overview
This repository contains the SQL scripts, documentation, and additional resources for a database designed to manage the operations of Alvand Tile & Ceramic Industries. The project, completed two years ago, includes a MySQL database schema for operational details, production capacities, employee management, and environmental impact assessments. As of the time of writing, I no longer have access to the actual company data used during the project's development. Therefore, the repository includes generalized or anonymized data structures and test data, designed to illustrate the database functionalities without revealing sensitive information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

MySQL Server (Version 8.0 or newer recommended): This project was initially developed using MySQL Server 8.0. This version introduced significant updates and features that may be necessary for optimal performance and compatibility with the project scripts.
MySQL Workbench (Version 8.0 or newer recommended): To manage the database schema and execute SQL scripts, MySQL Workbench 8.0 or newer is recommended due to enhancements that support newer SQL standards and improved usability features.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Tima-R/AlvandTileCompanyDatabase.git
    ```

2. **Create the database** by running the `schema.sql` script in MySQL Workbench. This script will create the `AlvandTileCompanyDatabase` database along with all required tables.

3. **Populate the database** with initial test data by executing the `insert_data.sql` script.

### Directory Structure

- `/sql` - Contains SQL scripts for creating the database schema (`schema.sql`) and inserting test data (`insert_data.sql`).
- `/docs` - Contains the project documentation, including the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and other relevant documentation.

## Usage
